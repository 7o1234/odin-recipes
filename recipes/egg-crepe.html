    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
<li>Crack 2 large eggs into a small bowl; season with kosher salt and beat well to blend. Toss ¼ cup cilantro and/or mint leaves with the juice of 1 lime wedge in another small bowl; season with salt and set aside.

</li>
<li>Heat 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add 1 large shallot, thinly sliced, 1 jalapeño, seeds removed if desired, finely chopped, and 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped; season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until shallot is slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle 1 Tbsp. mustard seeds, 1 tsp. ground cumin, and 1 tsp. ground turmeric over, using a swooping motion to streak the spices across the pan. Spray with nonstick vegetable oil spray (if using); do not stir. 

</li>
<li>Pour eggs into skillet, tilting pan to spread into a very thin layer. Cover with a lid and cook until top of crepe is just set, 1–2 minutes.

</li>
<li>Scatter reserved herbs over half of crepe. Using a heatproof spatula, fold other half of crepe up and over herbs, then slide crepe onto a plate. Serve with ketchup.

</li>
    </ol>
